1) Dowload git and make a github account.
2) Go to an area on your computer you will be working on the project
3) Right click to open up options with the folder and select 'git bash'
 - This will open up bash where you can type in commands such as 'git add <file>' 
4) Put in 'git clone https://github.com/MSUCSC450Group2/KnittingWithPython.git'
 - This will create a clone of the repository on your computer
 - Note we will not be directly modifying all these (known as the master branch). We will be creating branches for individual features mostly.
